# TAOS TSL2561 sensor

This sensor measures luminosity. The driver code is mostly implemented
except for the interrupt functionality which will respond when the light
conditions change. The datasheet is:

  * [TSL2561 Datasheet](TSL2561.pdf)

The interface for the sensor is:

```
type TSL2561 interface {
	gopi.Driver

	// Get Version
	ChipIDVersion() (uint8, uint8)

	// Get Gain
	Gain() TSL2561Gain

	// Get Integrate Time
	IntegrateTime() TSL2561IntegrateTime

	// Set Gain
	SetGain(TSL2561Gain) error

	// Set Integrate Time
	SetIntegrateTime(TSL2561IntegrateTime) error

	// Read Luminosity Value in Lux
	ReadSample() (float64, error)
}
```

In order to create a sensor object, you can import the following modules
anonymously into your application:

| Import                                  | Module Name     | Sensor  | Interface |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | --------- |
| github.com/djthorpe/sensors/sys/tsl2561 | sensors/tsl2561 | TSL2561 | I2C       |

For the I2C driver, you will also need to import the module `github.com/djthorpe/gopi-hw/sys/i2c`
anonymously. For example,

```
package main

import (
  "os"
  "fmt"

  // Frameworks
  "github.com/djthorpe/gopi"
  "github.com/djthorpe/sensors"

  // Modules
  _ "github.com/djthorpe/sensors/sys/tsl2561"
  _ "github.com/djthorpe/gopi-hw/sys/i2c"
)

const (
  TSL2561 = "sensors/tsl2561"
)

func Main(app *gopi.AppInstance, done chan<- struct{}) error {
  tsl2561 := app.ModuleInstance(TSL2561).(sensors.TSL2561)
  fmt.Println("TSL2561=",tsl2561)
  return nil
}

func main() {
  config := gopi.NewAppConfig(TSL2561)
  os.Exit(gopi.CommandLineTool(config, Main))
}
```

## Wiring

In order to connect it to the Raspberry Pi, here are the pin 
configurations. The AdaFruit product is listed here as an 
example but there are other ways to connect (more information
is available at https://learn.adafruit.com/tsl2561). The pin numbers
here are provided for connecting the AdaFruit product with a Raspberry PI
and are for the physical board pins:

| TSL2561 Pin  | GPIO Pin | Description            |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Vin          |  2       | 3-5VDC power in        |
| GND          |  6       | Ground                 |
| 3Vo          |          | 3.3V power out         |
| Addr         |          | I2C Address Change     |
| Int          |          | Light Change Interrupt |
| SDA          |  3       | I2C Data               |
| SCL          |  5       | I2C Clock              |

The I2C slave address defaults to 0x39. By connecting the Addr 
pin to ground, this changes to 0x29 and connecting to 3.3V 
it changes to 0x49.

## The Command Line Tool example

In order to install and/or run the command-line tool, use the
following:

```
  bash% cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/djthorpe/sensors
  bash% go (run|install) cmd/tsl2561.go
```

The command line tool demonstrates everything you need to know about
using the sensor interface. You can run it with one of the following
commands:

  * `tsl2561 status` Displays the current sensor status
  * `tsl2561 measure` Measures Illuminance

There are also various flags you can use in order to set integration time
and gain. Here are the main flags you can use on the command line:

```
  -integrate_time float
    	Integration time, milliseconds (13.7, 101 or 402)
  -gain uint
    	Sample gain (1,16)
```

There are a set of additional flags you can also use:

```
  -i2c.bus uint
    	I2C Bus (default 1)
  -i2c.slave uint
    	I2C Slave address (default 0x77)
  -debug
    	Set debugging mode
  -verbose
    	Verbose logging
  -log.append
    	When writing log to file, append output to end of file
  -log.file string
    	File for logging (default: log to stderr)
```

Ultimately when the sensor is measured, it is powered up, a delay is made to wait
for the measurement to be made, and then the value is sampled before power down:

```
bash% tsl2561 measure
+-------------+------------+
| MEASUREMENT |   VALUE    |
+-------------+------------+
| illuminance | 642.48 Lux |
+-------------+------------+
```

See typical values for Illuminance on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminance):

| Lighting condition  | Lux value |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Full daylight       | 10000     |
| Overcast day        | 1000      |
| Very dark day       | 100       |
| Twilight            | 10        |
| Deep twilight       | 1         |
| Full moon           | 0.1       |
| Quarter moon        | 0.01      |
| Starlight           | 0.001     |


Here is what the status output looks like, also setting the gain and integration time:

```
bash% tsl2561 -gain 16 -integrate_time 402 status
+----------------+-----------------------------+
|    REGISTER    |            VALUE            |
+----------------+-----------------------------+
| chip_id        | 0x05                        |
| chip_version   | 0x00                        |
| integrate_time | TSL2561_INTEGRATETIME_402MS |
| gain           | TSL2561_GAIN_16             |
+----------------+-----------------------------+
```
