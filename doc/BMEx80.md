# Bosch BMEx80 sensors

These sensors measure temperature, humidity, pressure and air quality and can
communicate over both SPI and I2C. For the moment, the BME280 is mostly implemented
and the BME680 (which also includes air quality sensing) is not completed. The
datasheets are:

  * [BME280 Datasheet](BME280.pdf)
  * [BME680 Datasheet](BME680.pdf)

The interface for the sensors are as follows:

```
type BME280 interface {
	gopi.Driver

	// Get Version
	ChipIDVersion() (uint8, uint8)

	// Get Mode
	Mode() BME280Mode

	// Return IIR filter co-officient
	Filter() BME280Filter

	// Return standby time
	Standby() BME280Standby

	// Return oversampling values osrs_t, osrs_p, osrs_h
	Oversample() (BME280Oversample, BME280Oversample, BME280Oversample)

	// Return current measuring and updating value
	Status() (bool, bool, error)

	// Return the measurement duty cycle (minimum duration between subsequent readings)
	// in normal mode
	DutyCycle() time.Duration

	// Reset
	SoftReset() error

	// Set BME280 mode
	SetMode(mode BME280Mode) error

	// Set Oversampling
	SetOversample(osrs_t, osrs_p, osrs_h BME280Oversample) error

	// Set Filter
	SetFilter(filter BME280Filter) error

	// Set Standby mode
	SetStandby(t_sb BME280Standby) error

	// Return raw sample data for temperature, pressure and humidity
	// Temperature in Celcius, Pressure in Pascals and humidity in
	// %age
	ReadSample() (float64, float64, float64, error)

	// Return altitude in meters for given pressure in Pascals
	AltitudeForPressure(atmospheric, sealevel float64) float64
}

type BME680 interface {
	gopi.Driver

	// Get ChipID
	ChipID() uint8

	// Reset
	SoftReset() error
}
```

More information about wiring up the sensors and using the examples is given
in the following sections.

## BME280

The Bosch BME280 measures temperature, humidity and pressure. You can
interface this device either through I2C or SPI. The datasheet is
provided in the "doc" folder.

In order to connect it to the Raspberry Pi, here are the two 
configurations of the pins on the BME280 device. The AdaFruit
product is listed here as an example but there are other ways
to connect (more information
is avilable at https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652). The pin numbers
here are provided for connecting the AdaFruit product with a Raspberry PI
and are for the physical board pins:

| BME280 Pin   | I2C | SPI(0) | Description                    |
| ------------ | --- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Vin          |  2  |  2     | 3-5VDC power in                |
| 3Vo          |     |        | 3.3V power out                 |
| GND          |  6  |  6     | Ground                         |
| SCK          |  5  | 23     | SPI/I2C Clock Pin              |
| SDO/MISO     |     | 21     | Serial Data Out                |
| SDI/SDA/MOSI |  3  | 19     | Serial Data In / I2C Data Pin  |
| CS           |     | 24     | Chip Select                    |

Using the I2C connection bus, the slave address defaults to 0x77.

In order to install and/or run the command-line tool, you
need to deploy the correct flavour using tags. Here is how
you can can install and/or run when you want to use the I2C
flavour:

```
  bash% cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/djthorpe/sensors
  bash% go (run|install) -tags i2c cmd/bme280.go
```

When you want to install or run a version which communicates over the 
SPI bus:

```
  bash% cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/djthorpe/sensors
  bash% go (run|install) -tags spi cmd/bme280.go
```

The command line tool demonstrates everything you need to know about
using the sensor interface. You can run it with one of the following
commands:


  * `bme280 reset` Resets the sensor and displays the sensor status
  * `bme280 status` Displays the current sensor status
  * `bme280 measure` Measures Temperature, Pressure and/or Humidity

There are also various flags you can use in order to set filter,
mode, oversampling or standby time. Here are the main flags you can use
on the command line:

```
  -filter uint
    	Set filter co-efficient (0,2,4,8,16)
  -mode string
    	Set sensor mode (normal,forced,sleep)
  -oversample uint
    	Set oversampling of measurements (0,1,2,4,8,16)
  -standby float
    	Standby time between measurements in normal mode, ms (0.5,10,20,62.5,125,250,500,1000)
```

There are a set of additional flags you can also use, some of which are available for I2C and others for SPI:

```
  -i2c.bus uint
    	I2C Bus (default 1)
  -i2c.slave uint
    	I2C Slave address (default 0x77)
  -spi.speed uint
    	SPI Communication Speed
  -debug
    	Set debugging mode
  -verbose
    	Verbose logging
  -log.append
    	When writing log to file, append output to end of file
  -log.file string
    	File for logging (default: log to stderr)
```

The modes of operation are essentailly "forced" or "normal". Forced
mode can be used for one-off measurement, or otherwise you can read
measurements with a particular duty cycle, which is a function of
standby time and oversampling values. Here's an example of status
output demonstrating this:

```
bash% bme280 status
+------------------------+----------------------+
|        REGISTER        |        VALUE         |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| chip_id                | 0x60                 |
| chip_version           | 0x00                 |
| mode                   | BME280_MODE_NORMAL   |
| filter                 | BME280_FILTER_OFF    |
| standby                | BME280_STANDBY_500MS |
| duty cycle             | 558ms                |
| oversample temperature | BME280_OVERSAMPLE_8  |
| oversample pressure    | BME280_OVERSAMPLE_8  |
| oversample humidity    | BME280_OVERSAMPLE_8  |
| measuring              | false                |
| updating               | false                |
+------------------------+----------------------+

```

In this example, the standby time is 500ms, measurement time is 
58ms and you shouldn't poll for new measurements more than once 
every 558ms (the duty cycle).

In forced mode only one measurement is taken before the sensor
returns to sleep mode:

```
bash% bme280 -mode forced measure
+-------------+------------+
| MEASUREMENT |   VALUE    |
+-------------+------------+
| temperature |   20.03 Â°C |
|    pressure | 998.61 hPa |
|    altitude |   122.64 m |
|    humidity |  53.52 %RH |
+-------------+------------+

```
